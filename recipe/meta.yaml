  patches:
    # upstream uses a hack to ensure an executable built for the
    # build process itself has the right (=host) CPU type;
    # the hack unsets the CC variable, meaning it'll pick up the host
    # compiler (on osx: xcode) rather than our own infrastructure;
    # obviously we should do this properly also on osx-arm
    - patches/0001-don-t-unset-required-environment-flags.patch  # [not (osx and arm64)]
